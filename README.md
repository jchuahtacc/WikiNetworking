# WikiNetworking

### Introduction

This project consists of two Jupyter notebooks that crawl Wikipedia articles and text mine them for links to build a node graph representation of the relationships between articles.

[Wiki Networking - Text Mining Tools.ipynb](Wiki%20Networking%20-%20Text%20Mining%20Tools.ipynb) contains text mining and web crawling code for retrieving link data from Wikipedia pages.

[Wiki Networking.ipynb](Wiki%20Networking.ipynb) contains an example of how to load the result of a Wikipedia crawl and create a weighted node graph.
